        <h2>1. Controller</h2>
        <p>
          The controller responsible for data processing on this website is:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>SNS Software Solutions GmbH</strong>
          <br />
          Schrötlgasse 8a, 1220 Vienna, Austria
          <br />
          Email:{' '}
          <a href="mailto:office@sns-austria.com">
            office@sns-austria.com
          </a>
        </p>

        <h2>2. Overview</h2>
        <p>
          We take the protection of your personal data seriously and process it
          only in accordance with statutory data protection regulations (GDPR,
          Austrian Data Protection Act / DSG) and this privacy policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          This policy covers two different things, and the distinction matters
          for your rights. <strong>Our websites</strong> (sns-austria.com and
          immvela.com) are informational, and we collect as little personal data
          as possible there — Sections 3 and 5 to 12 apply.{' '}
          <strong>Immvela</strong>, the platform our clients sign in to, is
          different: there we mostly process data on a client’s behalf rather
          than our own, which changes who you should address a request to.
          Section 4 covers it.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Hosting</h2>
        <p>
          This website is hosted by <strong>Vercel Inc.</strong>, 340 S Lemon
          Ave #4133, Walnut, CA 91789, USA. When you visit the site, Vercel
          automatically processes technical connection data (see “Server log
          files” below) to deliver the website securely and reliably. This is
          based on our legitimate interest in a stable and secure online
          presence (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR). We have concluded a data processing
          agreement (DPA) with Vercel, and transfers to the USA are safeguarded
          by the EU Standard Contractual Clauses.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Immvela (our real-estate platform)</h2>
        <p>
          In addition to this website, SNS operates <strong>Immvela</strong> (
          <a href="https://www.immvela.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            immvela.com
          </a>
          , application at app.immvela.com), a modular platform for real-estate
          agents and brokerages in Austria, Germany and Switzerland. Immvela is
          a product of SNS Software Solutions GmbH and not a separate legal
          entity; this privacy policy covers both domains. Modules are enabled
          individually, so which of the processing described below actually
          applies depends on the modules a given brokerage uses.
        </p>

        <h3>4.1 Who is controller, and who is processor</h3>
        <p>
          For the data a brokerage puts into Immvela about its own properties,
          clients and prospects, the <strong>brokerage is the controller</strong>{' '}
          and <strong>SNS acts as processor</strong> on its instructions
          (Art. 28 GDPR), under a separate written agreement including a Data
          Processing Agreement (AVV). For the brokerage’s own account and
          contract data, SNS is the controller.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each brokerage is a separate tenant and its own controller. Where a
          brokerage belongs to a franchise, franchise offices do{' '}
          <strong>not</strong> have access to each other’s operational data;
          a franchise can share reference material downward only by deliberate
          publication, never operational records about properties or people.
        </p>

        <h3>4.2 Data we process on behalf of clients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Account data for the brokerage’s users: name, email address, role
            within the organisation, and interface-language preference.
          </li>
          <li>
            Property and listing records, including descriptive and technical
            attributes such as floor area, year of construction and energy
            certificate values.
          </li>
          <li>
            Contacts, leads and deals — that is, personal data about prospective
            buyers, sellers or tenants that the brokerage enters or receives.
          </li>
          <li>
            Documents the brokerage uploads (for example energy performance
            certificates) and the values read out of them. Extracted values are
            always shown to the brokerage for confirmation before the platform
            relies on them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Media the brokerage uploads or has generated: photographs, staged
            images and walkthrough footage.
          </li>
          <li>
            Text the platform drafts on the brokerage’s instruction (listing
            copy, captions, Exposé documents) and the brokerage’s edits to it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Access tokens issued by connected publishing platforms, used solely
            to publish on the brokerage’s behalf and to retrieve the resulting
            engagement data.
          </li>
          <li>
            Engagement data returned by those platforms (for example views,
            reactions and post statistics).
          </li>
          <li>
            Records of platform activity showing which module produced or used
            which record, used to operate the service and to make the
            brokerage’s own data reusable across modules.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.3 Purpose and legal basis</h3>
        <p>
          This data is processed solely to provide the functions the brokerage
          has enabled. The legal basis is performance of the agreement with the
          brokerage (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR) and our legitimate interest in providing
          the contracted service (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR). Where a brokerage
          processes data about third parties such as prospective buyers, the
          brokerage is responsible for the legal basis for that processing.
        </p>

        <h3>4.4 AI processing, and what it does not decide</h3>
        <p>
          Several Immvela modules generate text or images using AI. For text
          generation, the relevant listing and property data is transmitted to{' '}
          <strong>Anthropic PBC</strong> (Claude models) acting as a
          sub-processor, solely to produce the output the brokerage asked for.
          Under Anthropic’s commercial API terms, data submitted through the API
          is not used to train their models. We do not sell client data, use it
          for advertising, or use it to train AI models of our own.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two limits are built into the platform rather than left to policy.
          Factual values in generated text are taken only from data the
          brokerage has confirmed, so the platform does not invent property
          specifications. And AI-staged images carry a “virtually staged” label
          rendered into the image itself, so a staged photograph stays
          identifiable as staged wherever it is published.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>No automated decision-making.</strong> Immvela does not make
          decisions about individuals that have legal or similarly significant
          effects within the meaning of Art. 22 GDPR. Where a module qualifies
          or routes an enquiry, it gathers and prepares information for a person
          to act on; it does not agree prices, appointments or contractual terms,
          and anything binding is confirmed by a human.
        </p>

        <h3>4.5 Storage and sub-processors</h3>
        <p>Immvela’s data is stored in the European Union:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Database, authentication and file storage:{' '}
            <strong>Supabase</strong>, hosted in the EU (eu-central-1,
            Frankfurt, Germany)
          </li>
          <li>
            Application hosting: <strong>Vercel</strong> (see Section 3 for
            Vercel’s data handling)
          </li>
          <li>
            Background job processing: <strong>Trigger.dev</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            AI text generation: <strong>Anthropic PBC</strong> (see Section 4.4)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Platform access tokens are encrypted at rest. Access by SNS personnel
          is restricted to those who need it and is logged. Where a
          sub-processor involves a transfer outside the EU/EEA, that transfer is
          covered by a data processing agreement and safeguarded by the EU
          Standard Contractual Clauses.
        </p>

        <h3>4.6 Connected publishing platforms</h3>
        <p>
          Each connected platform (Meta/Facebook/Instagram, LinkedIn,
          Google/YouTube, TikTok) processes data under its own privacy policy and
          developer terms. Our use of data obtained through these platforms
          complies with each platform’s respective developer policies and terms
          of service.
        </p>

        <h3>4.7 Retention, media deletion and erasure requests</h3>
        <p>
          Client and account data is retained for the duration of the agreement
          and deleted within 30 days of account disconnection or termination,
          except where retention is required by law.
        </p>
        <p>
          Media a brokerage uploads or has generated is retained until the
          brokerage deletes it or its account is deleted.{' '}
          <strong>
            There is currently no automatic deletion of media files.
          </strong>{' '}
          Deleting our copy does not remove anything already published to a
          third-party platform, which remains subject to that platform’s own
          retention.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are a buyer, seller or tenant whose data a brokerage holds in
          Immvela, that brokerage is your controller and is the right first point
          of contact for an erasure request. When a brokerage passes such a
          request to us, we erase that person’s records across the platform,
          including derived records, values extracted from documents, generated
          documents and stored files. We carry this out by hand, within 30 days;
          there is currently no automated erasure flow in the application. We may retain a record that a business
          event occurred where it no longer identifies the person and statutory
          retention applies. Brokerages may request deletion or disconnection at
          any time by contacting{' '}
          <a href="mailto:office@sns-austria.com">office@sns-austria.com</a>.

        <h2>5. Server log files</h2>
        <p>
          Our hosting provider automatically collects and stores information in
          server log files that your browser transmits to us. These may
          include:

          This data is not merged with other data sources and is used solely to
          ensure operation, security, and troubleshooting. The legal basis is
          Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Analytics</h2>
        <p>
          We use <strong>Vercel Analytics</strong>, a privacy-friendly,
          cookieless analytics service provided by Vercel Inc. It measures
          aggregated, anonymous usage statistics (such as page views) without
          using cookies and without tracking or identifying individual
          visitors. No cross-site profiles are created. The legal basis is our
          legitimate interest in understanding and improving the use of our
          website (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR).
        </p>

        <h2>7. Cookies</h2>

          This website does not set tracking or advertising cookies. Only
          technically necessary storage required to display the site may be
          used. Because we do not use non-essential cookies, no cookie consent
          banner is required.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Contact (email &amp; contact form)</h2>
        <p>
          If you contact us by email, the data you provide (your email address
          and the content of your message) is processed solely to handle your
          enquiry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our website also provides a contact form. When you submit it, we

          optional phone number, the type of service you select, and your
          message, in order to respond to your enquiry. The legal basis is Art.
          6(1)(b) GDPR (steps prior to entering a contract) or Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR
          (our legitimate interest in responding to enquiries).
        </p>
        <p>
          Contact form submissions are delivered to our mailbox on our behalf
