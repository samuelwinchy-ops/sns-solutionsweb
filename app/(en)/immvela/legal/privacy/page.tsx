/**
 * Immvela's own privacy policy, served at www.immvela.com/legal/privacy.
 *
 * ── Why this exists as a separate document ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * app.immvela.com/privacy 307s to this exact URL, and every platform review
 * form (Meta, TikTok, LinkedIn, Google/YouTube) fetches it and checks that it
 * describes the app in front of the reviewer. Until this page existed,
 * immvela.com/legal/privacy fell through middleware to the SNS policy — a
 * byte-identical copy titled "Privacy Policy | SNS Solutions" that declared
 * `canonical: https://www.sns-austria.com/legal/privacy`. It covered Immvela
 * well (its section 4 still does, for the SNS-domain audience), but it told
 * every crawler the real document lived on another company-branded domain,
 * which is the "why is a different company's policy covering this app?"
 * question a submission does not want to invite.
 *
 * The accepted cost is drift: two documents now describe overlapping
 * processing and can disagree. That was traded deliberately against the
 * reviewer question above. Anything changed here about tokens, engagement,
 * retention or deletion must be checked against section 4 of the SNS policy
 * (app/(en)/legal/privacy) and against /legal/data-deletion next door.
 *
 * ── Why BOTH languages are on one page, German first ────────────────────────
 *
 * Same reasoning as the app's /data-deletion page, and deliberately the same
 * shape. The two readers are a DACH agent and an English-speaking platform
 * reviewer; both arrive signed out at the one URL the app hard-codes, so
 * neither can be served by a locale preference. German leads because the
 * market is AT/DE/CH. Bilingual legal pages are ordinary here. This is not a
 * precedent for the rest of the site, which keeps using the locale layer —
 * /de/legal/privacy on this host renders this same page (middleware.ts) and
 * canonicalises here.
 *
 * ── What this deliberately does NOT say ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Each omission is on purpose; adding one would describe a product that does
 * not exist, which is the expensive kind of wrong in this document.
 *
 *   • No claim about which legal basis applies, and no citation of any
 *     statute. That is counsel's to add.
 *   • No retention period for publication records. They are kept indefinitely
 *     (`event` rows, kept permanently by decision — a stated period is a
 *     product change first, wording second).
 *   • No monthly media wipe as a live feature. The job exists but is DRY-RUN
 *     by default and unarmed in production (IMMVELA_MEDIA_WIPE_ARMED absent is
 *     the intended state), so the text says retention is until you delete.
 *   • No automated account-deletion flow. Deletion is a hand-run script, so
 *     the text says "by hand".
 *   • No Data Deletion Callback. Meta accepts an instructions URL instead, and
 *     that is what SNS provides; a callback needs an erasure job behind it
 *     that does not exist, and one that silently does nothing is worse than
 *     none.
 *
 * ── The Google/YouTube round, 2026-09-10 ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Google OAuth verification bounced with: "Your privacy policy does not specify
 * any data protection mechanisms for sensitive data." Two sections answer it:
 *
 *   • "Schutz Ihrer Daten / How we protect your data" — the finding itself.
 *   • "Nutzung der YouTube API Services / Use of YouTube API Services" — NOT in
 *     the finding list, but a standing YouTube API Services Developer Policies
 *     §III.A.2 requirement the reviewer checks: the YouTube ToS link, the
 *     Google Privacy Policy link, what API data is used, and revocation via the
 *     Google security settings page. Publishing without it invites a second
 *     round.
 *
 * ⚠️ **The two scope names are load-bearing and must match three places on the
 * day the reviewer looks**: this page, the Cloud Console, and `YOUTUBE_SCOPES`.
 * The bounce included "scopes shown … different from the scopes configured", so
 * a drift here is the defect under review. Verified 2026-09-11 against the app
 * repo's `origin/main`: exactly `youtube.upload` + `youtube.readonly`. The
 * broad `auth/youtube` scope this page would have mis-stated was removed in
 * their PR #1260 — the handoff was written while it was still live and warned
 * the claim was false; it is true now, which is why it was re-checked rather
 * than trusted either way.
 *
 * ⚠️ **This policy must also be LINKED from the OAuth consent screen** in Google
 * Cloud Console. Google checks the link, not just the text, and nothing in this
 * repo can do that.
 *
 * ⚠️ **One bullet from the source draft is deliberately NOT published**: "Our
 * own access" (named staff, individual accounts, two-factor). It arrived marked
 * `‹confirm›`, nobody here can verify who holds the Supabase and Vercel
 * credentials or whether 2FA is enforced, and the draft's own instruction was
 * to make it true and publish it or cut it — never publish it unverified,
 * because Google reads a security section as a set of commitments. Cut. It goes
 * back in when a human confirms it.
 *
 * ── Every factual claim, verified against the app repo's main ───────────────
 *
 * Verified 2026-09-05. If one becomes false, this text becomes false.
 *
 *   • Tokens encrypted at rest — crypto/token-encryption.ts (AES-256-GCM).
 *   • Disconnecting hard-deletes the row and its tokens — connection.ts
 *     `deleteConnection`, a real DELETE, not a soft delete.
 *   • Insights scopes ARE requested — `read_insights` and
 *     `instagram_manage_insights` in modules/publishing/platforms/meta.ts.
 *     This is why the purpose sentence below says "and to read aggregate
 *     engagement figures" rather than the older "solely to publish": a
 *     reviewer reads the requested permission list beside this text, and
 *     "asks to read insights, says it only writes" reads as either an
 *     over-broad request or an inaccurate disclosure.
 *   • Engagement ingestion is live — worker/engagement-sweep.ts, armed in
 *     production since 2026-08-28. It emits aggregate per-post metrics only.
 *   • Listing text and the ADDRESS go to Anthropic — modules/quill/prompt.ts;
 *     the address is the listing's identity and is in the prompt.
 *   • Media in a private Supabase bucket, reached by short-lived signed URLs —
 *     modules/publishing/storage.ts.
 *   • Deleting a media asset cascades its `scheduled_post` rows
 *     (0011_publishing.sql) but NOT its `event` rows — retention.ts is
 *     explicit that `content.published` history survives a wipe "which is the
 *     point". Hence the split wording under Aufzeichnungen / Records.
 *   • Full account deletion is manual, within 30 days — no erasure job exists;
 *     docs/gdpr-erasure.md is a design document.
 *
 * For the sections added in the Google round, verified 2026-09-11 against
 * `origin/main`:
 *
 *   • exactly two YouTube scopes — `platforms/youtube.ts` `YOUTUBE_SCOPES`.
 *   • channel name and id read via `channels?part=snippet&mine=true` —
 *     `platforms/accounts.ts:318`.
 *   • view/like/comment totals and NOTHING else — `posting/insights/youtube.ts`
 *     `YOUTUBE_VIDEO_STATISTICS` is exactly those three. ⚠️ If that constant
 *     grows, this page is stale.
 *   • AES-256-GCM before storage — `crypto/token-encryption.ts`,
 *     `createCipheriv("aes-256-gcm", …)`.
 *   • key in the runtime environment, never in Postgres — same file, read from
 *     `process.env.TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`.
 *   • refuses to store rather than write plaintext — same file, throws when
 *     `NODE_ENV === "production"` and the key is unset. ⚠️ Development warns
 *     and writes plaintext, which is why the sentence is scoped to production.
 *   • ~~row-level security enforces tenant separation — `supabase/migrations/`,
 *     RLS policies across ten migration files.~~ **CORRECTED 2026-09-13 — see
 *     the round below. RLS alone was an over-claim.**
 *   • ⚠️ "encrypted at rest by Supabase" is the ONE claim here not verifiable
 *     from either repo — it is a property of their platform and plan. It is
 *     published because it is the substance of Google's finding, and flagged
 *     for a human to confirm.
 *
 * ── The app repo's own review round, 2026-09-13 ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * The 2026-09-10 draft that produced this page was itself reviewed in the app
 * repo (`docs/legal-immvela-privacy-policy.md`, commit 3582744b) and several of
 * its claims were corrected there AFTER this page had been published from the
 * pre-review version. This page was behind by four paragraphs. Each correction
 * is re-verified here against the app repo's `origin/main`, not copied across:
 *
 *   • **Whole uploaded DOCUMENTS go to Anthropic, not only property details.**
 *     `lib/extraction/actions.ts:324` sends `documents: [{ mediaType,
 *     dataBase64 }]` — the file is downloaded, base64'd and sent entire. A
 *     `grundbuchauszug` (`lib/documents/kinds.ts`) routinely names owners and
 *     other parties, so third-party personal data leaves the platform. That was
 *     disclosed nowhere. It is the most material of the set.
 *   • **The agent's own kept texts are sent as style samples.**
 *     `modules/quill/voice.ts:72` reads `quill_edit` rows with `kind = 'kept'`,
 *     pinned to the agent's own org and user, and `modules/quill/actions.ts:721`
 *     passes them into the generation. ⚠️ The source draft called this a
 *     "stored style profile"; there is no such setting, and the wording here
 *     says what the code does instead.
 *   • **Anthropic's processor entry had to widen** to name document extraction,
 *     which follows from the first bullet: an entry naming only "text
 *     generation" understates what that processor processes.
 *   • **Tenant separation is checked in the application AND at row level.** The
 *     old sentence said RLS did it "rather than by the application, so an
 *     application fault cannot lift it" — refuted three ways by the app repo's
 *     own files: `docs/tenancy-enforcement.md` requires both and says not to
 *     treat RLS as sufficient on its own; `modules/publishing/CLAUDE.md` records
 *     that `storage.objects` has NO policies, so media tenancy is the
 *     application's; and the service role bypasses RLS on the paths that write
 *     this data. Google reads a security section as a set of commitments, and
 *     this was a commitment the code does not keep.
 *   • **The YouTube stored-data list gained two items** — the token's expiry and
 *     the granted-permission list, both columns on `platform_connection`
 *     (`0011_publishing.sql`: `token_expires_at`, `scopes`). That list is
 *     exhaustive by its own wording ("Nothing further"), so an omission makes
 *     the sentence false rather than merely short.
 *
 * ⚠️ **Deliberately NOT taken from that round: the Deletion and Records
 * wording.** The app repo's draft is BEHIND this page on both — it still points
 * at `app.immvela.com/data-deletion`, which the 2026-09-05 split retired, and it
 * files the scheduled-posts sentence under Retention where this page has it
 * under Records. A wholesale paste from that draft would regress both sections,
 * which is why the changes above are surgical.
 *
 * ⚠️ **"Our own access" is STILL cut.** That round did not change its
 * `‹confirm›` standing and nobody has confirmed it. See the note above.
 *
 * ── The parity round, 2026-09-15 ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The SNS policy at sns-austria.com/legal/privacy — the URL the OAuth consent
 * screen actually points at — gained its own 4.8/4.9 this day. Comparing the
 * two live documents surfaced two gaps on THIS page, neither of them a
 * contradiction, both of them this page being the weaker of the pair:
 *
 *   • **Google's Limited Use affirmation was absent entirely.** Not weak —
 *     absent: zero occurrences of "Limited Use", "User Data Policy" or "Google
 *     API Services" in the body. The substance was already here (the YouTube
 *     section promises no ads, no sale, nothing to the AI provider, no model
 *     training), but the sentence a reviewer string-matches was not, and the
 *     canonical form is "use **and transfer to any other app** ... **will
 *     adhere**", which is wider than a use-only claim. Added to both halves.
 *   • **The Disclosure bullet said "to no one beyond the processors named
 *     above"** while the whole product transmits posts to the platform the
 *     customer selects. A platform is a recipient, not a processor, so the
 *     bullet was false on its face and the saving context sat in a different
 *     section. Both halves now name the platforms.
 *
 * ── The Google email of 2026-09-08, read on 2026-09-15 ─────────────────────
 *
 * ⚠️ **THIS is the page Google reviews.** The Cloud Console registers home page
 * `https://immvela.com`, privacy `https://www.immvela.com/legal/privacy`, terms
 * `https://www.immvela.com/legal/terms`. A handoff that sent this round at the
 * SNS policy was working from the wrong premise; the SNS page was fixed anyway
 * (it was independently wrong) but it is NOT what the reviewer opens.
 *
 * The email's finding 1 is the SAME privacy-policy wording finding, and it
 * arrived **three days after** "Schutz Ihrer Daten" went live here on 09-05. So
 * a security section existing is demonstrably not sufficient on its own. What
 * this round adds is what the section did not have:
 *
 *   • **The Limited Use affirmation**, absent entirely (above).
 *   • **Cookies and device storage** — YouTube API Services Developer Policies
 *     §III.A.2(g) wants device storage disclosed and this page said nothing at
 *     all. The app sets a Supabase auth cookie (`lib/supabase/server.ts`).
 *   • **An organisational measure.** The section opened by promising technical
 *     AND organisational controls and listed six technical ones, because "Our
 *     own access" was cut on 09-05 as unverifiable. ⚠️ **It returns here in a
 *     NARROWED form**: the restriction only. The 2FA, named-accounts and
 *     individual-logins claims stay cut, and the logging claim stays cut, since
 *     no audit table exists. What remains is a commitment the company chooses to
 *     keep, not a mechanism this repo can verify — **if it is not true, cut it.**
 *   • **The tenant-separation bullet**, now corrected (see below).
 *
 * ── The wording-parity round, 2026-09-15 ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The SNS policy took a set of corrections this page did not, so for a few
 * hours the BETTER text was on the page nobody reviews. Ported here:
 *
 *   • `das schutzbedürftigste Datum, das wir halten` → `die
 *     sicherheitskritischsten Daten, die wir speichern`. Two anglicisms in six
 *     words: `Datum` as the singular of `Daten` reads to an Austrian reader as a
 *     CALENDAR DATE, and `Daten halten` is a calque — German *speichert* data.
 *     The superlative also narrows: "most sensitive" is contradicted by this
 *     page's own account of buyer and seller data; what was meant is
 *     security-criticality.
 *   • `im Ruhezustand verschlüsselt` → `verschlüsselt gespeichert`. *Ruhezustand*
 *     is a machine's HIBERNATION. There is no settled German calque for "at
 *     rest", and `verschlüsselt gespeichert` is the term this page itself used
 *     before the 09-05 round replaced it with an invention.
 *   • `Berechtigungen anfragen` → `anfordern`. `anfragen` means to ENQUIRE.
 *
 * ⚠️ **NOT ported: `Auftragsverarbeiter` → `Unterauftragsverarbeiter`.** The SNS
 * policy took that one because ITS §4.1 calls SNS the processor, so using the
 * same noun for Supabase two sections later read as "we may disclose data to
 * ourselves". This page never applies the noun to SNS and its section is titled
 * `Auftragsverarbeiter`, so the bullet's "oben genannten Auftragsverarbeiter" is
 * internally consistent. Strictly they ARE sub-processors — this page's last
 * section has SNS processing `in Ihrem Auftrag` — so the accurate fix renames
 * the SECTION too. That is a bigger call than a wording port and is left alone.
 *
 * ⚠️ The email's finding 2 (scope mismatch) is NOT a policy matter and is
 * already fixed in the app repo: the broad `auth/youtube` was removed 09-10, two
 * days after the email, and `main` carries exactly `youtube.upload` +
 * `youtube.readonly`. What is owed there is a DEPLOY check and a new demo video.
 *
 * **The tenant-separation bullet is now corrected here too.** "Checked in two
 * places" over-claims: the service role bypasses RLS on every token WRITE
 * (`platform_connection` carries a SELECT-only policy), so the application is
 * the only boundary on that path. Both live policies now say so.

                verbinden, fordern wir bei Google genau zwei Berechtigungen an — nicht mehr, als die
                Funktionen benötigen:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>youtube.upload</strong> — um Videos, die Sie in Immvela dafür auswählen,
                  in Ihren Kanal hochzuladen;
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>youtube.readonly</strong> — um den Namen und die Kennung Ihres Kanals
                  anzuzeigen und um zu den über Immvela veröffentlichten Videos die Gesamtzahlen für
                  Aufrufe, „Gefällt mir“ und Kommentare abzurufen.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                <strong>Welche YouTube-Daten wir speichern.</strong> Das Zugriffs- und das
                Erneuerungstoken (verschlüsselt), die Kennung und den Namen Ihres Kanals, die
                Kennung der über Immvela hochgeladenen Videos sowie die genannten Gesamtzahlen mit
                dem Zeitpunkt ihres Abrufs, dazu den Ablaufzeitpunkt des Tokens und die Liste der
                von Ihnen erteilten Berechtigungen. Mehr nicht: keine Kommentartexte, keine Namen von
                Kommentierenden, keine Angaben zur Zusammensetzung Ihres Publikums, keine

              <p>
                Wir treffen technische und organisatorische Maßnahmen, um die von uns verarbeiteten
                Daten zu schützen. Im Einzelnen:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Übertragung.</strong> Der gesamte Datenverkehr — zwischen Ihrem Browser
                  und Immvela ebenso wie zwischen Immvela und den Schnittstellen der Plattformen —
                  erfolgt ausschließlich verschlüsselt über TLS (HTTPS).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Zugriffstoken der verbundenen Konten.</strong> Diese Token sind die
                  sicherheitskritischsten Daten, die wir speichern, und werden vor dem Speichern
                  mit{' '}
                  <strong>AES-256-GCM</strong> verschlüsselt. Der Schlüssel liegt ausschließlich in
                  der Laufzeitumgebung und niemals in der Datenbank: ein Datenbankauszug allein
                  genügt nicht, um Zugriff auf Ihre Konten zu erlangen. Fehlt der Schlüssel, so
                  verweigert das System im Produktivbetrieb das Speichern, statt Token im Klartext
                  abzulegen.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Speicherung.</strong> Datenbank und Dateispeicher werden von Supabase
                  betrieben und dort verschlüsselt gespeichert.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Trennung der Mandanten.</strong> Jeder Datensatz ist genau einer
                  Organisation zugeordnet, und die Anwendung prüft diese Trennung bei jedem
                  Zugriff. Läuft eine Anfrage unter Ihrer eigenen Anmeldung, setzt die Datenbank
                  sie zusätzlich auf Zeilenebene durch (Row-Level-Security). Hintergrundaufgaben
                  und serverseitige Vorgänge, die ein Plattform-Token speichern, nutzen erweiterte
                  Datenbankrechte; dort ist die Prüfung der Anwendung die Grenze, ebenso wie bei
                  Dateien im Medienspeicher.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Mediendateien.</strong> Fotos und Videos liegen in nicht öffentlichem
                  Speicher und sind ausschließlich über kurzlebige, signierte Links erreichbar; es
                  gibt keine öffentlich abrufbare Adresse einer Ihrer Dateien.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Weitergabe.</strong> Wir verkaufen keine Daten. Eine Weitergabe erfolgt
                  ausschließlich an die oben genannten Auftragsverarbeiter und an die von Ihnen

              <p>
                When you connect an Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, TikTok or YouTube account to
                Immvela, we store the access token issued by that platform, a refresh token where
                one is issued, the platform&apos;s account identifier, and the account&apos;s
                display name. Tokens are encrypted before they are stored.
              </p>
              <p>
                We use them <strong>solely for three purposes</strong>: to publish posts on your
                behalf, to retrieve aggregate engagement figures from the platform for those posts,
                and to keep the connection valid.
              </p>
              <p>
                Those figures are <strong>totals per post and per platform</strong> — such as views,
                reach, reactions, comments, shares and clicks, each as a count — and are stored
                under the name the platform itself gives each metric. We retrieve{' '}
                <strong>nothing about individual people</strong> in the process: no commenter names,
                no comment text, and no audience breakdowns. We do not read private messages or

                  <strong>youtube.readonly</strong> — to show your channel&apos;s name and

                  published through Immvela.

              </ul>
              <p>
                <strong>What YouTube data we store.</strong> The access token and refresh token
                (encrypted), your channel&apos;s identifier and name, the identifiers of videos
                uploaded through Immvela, and the totals named above together with the time they
                were retrieved, plus the token&apos;s expiry time and the list of permissions you
                granted. Nothing further: no comment text, no commenter names, no audience
                breakdowns, no watch history, no subscriber lists.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>What we never do with it.</strong> YouTube data is not used for advertising,
                is not sold or disclosed to third parties, is not sent to our AI provider, and is
                not used to train AI models.

                When you generate text, we send the property details needed for it —{' '}
                <strong>including the property address</strong> and the property attributes you have
                confirmed — to our AI provider, Anthropic. The generated text and a record of the
                generation are stored by us.
              </p>
              <p>
                When you upload a document for extraction — an energy certificate (Energieausweis)
                or a land-register extract (Grundbuchauszug) — we send the{' '}
                <strong>complete file</strong> to Anthropic so that the values in it can be read
                out. A land-register extract may name owners and other parties. Some of your own
                previously kept texts are sent as well, as style samples, so that generation follows
                your writing style.
              </p>
              <p>
                Data from connected social accounts is not part of this and is not sent to
                Anthropic.

              <p>
                We store the fact <em>that</em> a post was published, with its time and channel,
                together with the aggregate figures retrieved for it. These records contain no
                credentials and nothing about individual commenters or your audience; they are
                attributed to your account.
              </p>
              <p>
                They <strong>remain</strong> when you delete a media file or disconnect an account.
                Deleting a media file removes the scheduled posts tied to it within Immvela; the
                record of a publication that already happened is kept.

            <Section lang="en" title="How we protect your data">
              <p>
                We maintain technical and organisational controls over the data we process.
                Specifically:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>In transit.</strong> All traffic — between your browser and Immvela, and
                  between Immvela and the platforms&apos; APIs — is encrypted with TLS (HTTPS).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Connected-account access tokens.</strong> These are the most
                  security-sensitive data we hold, and they are encrypted with{' '}
                  <strong>AES-256-GCM</strong> before they
                  are stored. The key exists only in the runtime environment and never in the
                  database, so a database dump on its own does not yield access to your accounts. If
                  the key is absent, the system refuses to store tokens in production rather than
                  falling back to plaintext.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>At rest.</strong> The database and file storage are operated by Supabase
                  and are encrypted at rest there.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Tenant separation.</strong> Every record belongs to exactly one
                  organisation, and the application checks that separation on every access. Where
                  a request runs under your own sign-in, the database enforces it a second time at
                  row level (row-level security). Background jobs and the server-side paths that
                  store a platform token run with elevated database rights, and there the
                  application check is the boundary, as it is for files in media storage.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Media files.</strong> Photos and videos are held in non-public storage and
                  are reachable only through short-lived signed links; no file of yours has a
                  publicly retrievable address.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Disclosure.</strong> We do not sell data. We disclose it only to the
                  processors named above and to the publishing platforms you connect.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Our own access.</strong> Access to production systems is limited to the
                  people who need it to operate and support the service.

              <p>
                Your content is retained until you delete it in Immvela or your account is deleted.{' '}
                <strong>There is currently no automatic deletion of media files.</strong> A post
                already published remains on the platform concerned and is removed by you there.

            <Section lang="en" title="Deletion">
              <p>
                You can disconnect an account yourself at any time under{' '}
                <em>Verlag → Connected accounts</em>; this permanently deletes the stored record
                including its tokens — it does not merely deactivate them.
              </p>
